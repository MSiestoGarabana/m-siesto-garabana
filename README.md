## 👋🏼 Hi there! 



My name is **Miguel Siesto**, web developer based in **Madrid**.

I'm a big fan of **React** and I'm very excited to be learning something new every day.

### 🤔 Why web development? 

I graduated in audiovisual communication because I was attracted to the possibilities of new forms of communication as well as cinematography and the creative process. 
For four years, I've been working on different projects mainly focused on urban sports and the aesthetics that have been generated around them.

Although I have been very focused on video editing and cinematography, I had always been attracted to the audiovisual possibilities of the web. However, I never dared to embark on the seemingly complicated path of programming. 

After much reflection I have chosen to dare and start my way in the world of web development to continue experimenting with new ways to create audiovisual experiences, and above all, to continue having fun :rocket:.
